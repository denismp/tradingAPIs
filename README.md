# tradingAPIs
The goal of this exercise is to consume trading APIs and get prices and orders from the orderbook from various exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Kraken. An API is an “application program interface”, usually provided for external access through RESTful Web Services, JSON-RPC or other communication protocols. It basically provides access to a company’s data.
